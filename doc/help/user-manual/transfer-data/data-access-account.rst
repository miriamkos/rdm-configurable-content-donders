Data access account
===================

In order to upload, download or view the content of files, you need a one-time data access password.

To get the data access password you first must login (Read: :ref:`How to login? <login-portal>`) in the portal (ttps://data.donders.ru.nl). After logging in, click on your display name at the top-right corner to open a drop-down menu, and select *Data Access Password*.

Your *username* and the *one-time password* for data-access will be displayed on the pop-up window. The username is a combination of the user ID and the home organization. **Note that your username is case sensitive**. The password is valid for 72 hours. If the password has expired, you can simply repeat this procedure.

- :ref:`Mount as network drive <mount-network-drive>`
- :ref:`Cyberduck <cyberduck>`
- :ref:`Thunar <thunar>`
- :ref:`Cadaver <cadaver>`
