The Donders Repository in a nutshell
====================================

Research Data Management (RDM) aims to improve the research **efficiency and transparency**, and to fulfill the **requirements** of the university, funders, and legislation. The Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (DI) uses a Data Repository (DR) for data management. The repository serves three purposes:

* **Data preservation** for internal reuse
* **Research documentation** for increasing reusability and reproducibility
* **Data sharing** with the external scientific community

Collections
-----------
The data repository allows a researcher to archive digital data into **collections**. It contains separate collections for preservation, for research documentation and for sharing:

* In a **Data Acquisition Collection** (DAC), the data are archived in their original form. Here, original means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data.
* A **Research Documentation Collection** (RDC) documents the process via which data are converted into published results.
* A **Data Sharing Collection** (DSC) contains the data that on which published results are based, allowing external researchers to extend scientific findings by reanalyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data.

Authorisation
-------------
Repository users can have different predefined roles in a collection. These roles differ in their rights with respect to the collection:

#. A **manager** can add and remove users to the collection, and can change the role of other users. A manager also has the rights of a contributor.
#. A **contributor** can add, modify and delete files. A contributor also has the rights of a viewer.
#. A **viewer** can view the collection details and content and can download files.
   
Collections are always initiated by one of the research **administrators** that is part of the DI's administrative staff. As a part of the initiation, the research administrator assigns a manager to the collection; typically this is the supervisor of the research project to which this collection belongs. A collection manager can add other users to the collection in the role of manager, and these then obtain the same rights.

The three collections are built at different stages of a research project, see the figure below. For how to request the three collections, please check the DI `Intranet <https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=4977>`_ (for researchers in the DCCN) or the `introductory presentation <https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/presentations/>`_ (for researchers in the DCC). Note that an empirical research project can start from existing DACs and/or DSCs, and therefore it is not required that new data have to be acquired for such a project.
